This is a Dictionary app that allows a user to do the following:

- Written in Kotlin.
- Fetches a list of dog images from this api: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/random
- Shows the dog images in a recycler view
- Uses Picasso to show the images

Tools used: Android, Runnable, Handler, Dependency Injection, Kotlin, LiveData, MutableLiveData, Coroutines,
MVVM Architecture, Retrofit, Mockito, Room Database, Coroutines, Picasso

Future improvements that can be made:
- user tracking and analytics (most shown dog image)
- tests for validating and verifying images shown
- recycler view can be styled a bit more
- add DiffUtil for recyclerview
- error handling: show user error message when fetching dogs
